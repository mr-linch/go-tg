      - 1. This method will not work if an outgoing webhook is set up.

By default, updates starting with the earliest unconfirmed update are returned. An update is considered confirmed as soon as [getUpdates](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getupdates) is called with an offset higher than its update_id. The negative offset can be specified to retrieve updates starting from -offset update from the end of the updates queue. All previous updates will be forgotten.

Specify an empty list to receive all update types except chat_member, message_reaction, and message_reaction_count (default). If not specified, the previous setting will be used.  Please note that this parameter doesn't affect updates created before the call to getUpdates, so unwanted updates may be received for a short period of time.

  - name: setWebhook
    description:
      - Use this method to specify a URL and receive incoming updates via an outgoing webhook. Whenever there is an update for the bot, we will send an HTTPS POST request to the specified URL, containing a JSON-serialized [Update](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#update). In case of an unsuccessful request (a request with response [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) different from 2XY), we will repeat the request and give up after a reasonable amount of attempts. Returns True on success.
      - If you'd like to make sure that the webhook was set by you, you can specify secret data in the parameter secret_token. If specified, the request will contain a header “X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token” with the secret token as content.
      - Notes
      - 1. You will not be able to receive updates using [getUpdates](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getupdates) for as long as an outgoing webhook is set up.
      - 2. To use a self-signed certificate, you need to upload your [public key certificate](https://core.telegram.org/bots/self-signed) using certificate parameter. Please upload as InputFile, sending a String will not work.
